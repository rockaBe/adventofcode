# adventofcode
Simple approaches to solutions to the adventofcode puzzles.
Started in 2017, but did not really enjoy and find the time.
In 2018, I had more time and fun, but at some point, I was not pleased with the puzzles and stopped.

Now, in 2020 I am more ambitious to solve the puzzles - at least 80% of them. Currently (on day 5), I am still on the streak.
